A neat status line with color changing mode indicator. It is nowhere near as powerful as Powerline but if you just need something simple, fast and easy this will work great.

Information in the status line provided from left to right:

    - Vim Mode (green box)
    - Server name / session name (black box)
    - File path
    - File type (eg. python, ruby, etc..)
    - File format (eg. unix, dos, etc..)
    - File encoding (eg. utf8, latin1, etc..)
    - Buffer number
    - Current line, total number of lines (purple box)
    - Percentage of file read
    - Relative column number (from first character)
    - Absolute column number (from start of line)
    - Modified / Unmodified (pink box)

Works well with Obvious-Mode: vimscript#2212
